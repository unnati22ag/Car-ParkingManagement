# Parking-management-system-c

Project Overview

The Car Parking Management System is a console-based application developed in C Programming that automates parking slot allocation, vehicle entry and exit management, parking charge calculation, and record maintenance.

The system helps parking operators efficiently manage available parking spaces, track parked vehicles, generate parking receipts, and maintain historical records using file handling.

 # Objectives
- Automate parking slot allocation
- Maintain vehicle entry and exit records
- Calculate parking charges based on parking duration
- Track available and occupied parking slots
- Generate parking receipts
- Store data permanently using file handling
- Provide parking reports and revenue details

 # Features
# Vehicle Management
- Add new vehicle records
- Store vehicle number and owner details
- Assign parking slots automatically
- Track vehicle entry and exit time
- Search currently parked vehicles

 --- 
 # Parking Slot Management
- Automatic slot allocation
- Circular queue-based free slot management
- Real-time available slot tracking
- Slot reuse after vehicle exit
- Synchronization of slots after program restart

---

 # Billing System
- Calculates parking duration
- Generates automatic parking charges
### Parking Rates

 Vehicle Type  Charge Per Hour 
------------------------------
 Bike  Rs 20 
 Car  Rs 50 
 Bus  Rs 80 
 Truck  Rs 100 

---
## Reports

The system provides

- Current parked vehicle list
- Parking status report
- Revenue report
- Available slot display
